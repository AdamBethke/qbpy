Welcome!
++++++++

First off, thank you for considering contributing to qbpy. We're committed to
writing good code which makes working with Quick Base easier, and appreciate
your interest in helping us with that effort.

We ask that you read this guide to contributing, because it should help us all
work more efficiently. qbpy is a labor of love, and isn't anyone at the DC Public
Charter School Board's full-time job. We're open to making improvements that
enhance its usefulness, and need your help - whether you're interested in
submitting a minor patch or taking on a bigger role in managing the project.

To make sure we're able to keep qbpy effective and responsive to input, we've
created some guidelines which help us standardize how we approach issues, code
contributions, and feature requests.

Where to Start
++++++++++++++

We're interested in your support of the project; there are several ways to
contribute:

  - Improving qbpy's unit tests
  - Improving qbpy's efficiency
  - Developing additional formatters or macros to make Quick Base actions easier
  - Writing and/or improving documentation

We're also particularly interested in code which would support chunking uploads
for API_ImportFromCSV. If you're interested in collaborating on this issue,
please reach out to Adam Bethke at abethke "at" dcpcsb.org.

What We're Not Looking For
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

While we're interested in most forms of contribution, we're currently not
interested in exploring major changes to the public API.

We're also unable to provide a significant amount of support; we'll do our
best to answer questions when we can, but we're not able to promise any level
of support. Accordingly, please don't open issues with questions.

Security Requests
+++++++++++++++++

If you find a security vulnerability, do **not** open an issue. Please email
Adam Bethke at abethke "at" dcpcsb.org instead.
